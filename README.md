This Project deals with checking clinical efficacies of new cancer medicines introduced in the market with respect to already existing medicines. Studied 7 clinical trial reports for PROC depicting different treatments. Extracted the efficacy endpoints like median Overall Survival, median Progression Free Survival, Objective Response Rate. We then calculated the standard error for OS, PFS using the extracted LCL , UCL values for each and also calculated total number of partial and complete response cases in ORR. We then performed the meta-analysis using the metagen and metaprop functions in R (from the meta library) after which we visualized the analysis through forest plots to judge baseline heterogeneity among various trials. We performed the entire analysis for both fixed effect model and random effect model.
